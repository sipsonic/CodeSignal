Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index.
In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does.
If there are no such elements, return -1.

Example
For a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 3.
There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.
For a = [2, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 2;
For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = -1.

Input/Output
[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)
[input] array.integer a
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ a.length.

[output] integer
The element in a that occurs in the array more than once and has the minimal index for its second occurrence.
If there are no such elements, return -1.

// slow execution time:

int firstDuplicate(std::vector<int> a) {
    
    int duplicate = -1;
    int numHops = 10^5 + 1;
    
    // iterate through array and test for duplicates:
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        int currentNum = a[i];
        
        // inner loop:
        for (int n = i + 1; n < a.size(); n++) {
            int nextNum = a[n];
            
            // check for match:
            if ( (nextNum == currentNum) && (n < numHops) ) {
                duplicate = nextNum;
                numHops = n;
            }
        }
    }

    return duplicate;
}

// Faster execution time, O(n) time O(1) space:

int v2firstDuplicate(std::vector<int> a) {
    
    // return -1 if none found:
    int duplicate = -1;
    cout << a.size();
    
    // iterate through array and test for duplicates:
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        
        // hold current number and it's abs val:
        int currentNum = a[i];
        int absCurr = abs(currentNum) - 1;
        
        // check if the slot indexed by currentNum is positive,
        // if so, it hasn't been seen, so flip it:
        if ( a[absCurr] > 0) {
            a[absCurr] = a[absCurr] * -1;
        }
        // if it's negative, it's been seen, return it:
        else {
            return abs(a[i]);
        }
        
    }

    return duplicate;
}
